unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
the performances are an absolute joy .
on its own , it's not very interesting .
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood .
the draw [for " big bad love " ] is a solid performance by arliss howard .
earnest but heavy-handed .
decent but dull .
who needs love like this ?
