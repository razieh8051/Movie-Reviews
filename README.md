In this project, we built a tool using feature-based grammars that improves the Simplest Sentiment Analysis in Python (SSAP) tool for rating movie reviews. <br>
This work only intends to provide a grammar based strategy to improve the sentiments analysis for movie reviews.
<br>
Note that to run this project the main file for feature-ased grammar (SenGrammar.fcfg) is not publicly available (we provided another feature grammar file called gramtest.fcfg but this cannot be used to run the main project).

The description and detailed results of this project are avalible in file Report.pdf.
