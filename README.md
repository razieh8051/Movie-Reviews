In this project, we built a tool using feature-based grammars that improves the Simplest Sentiment Analysis in Python (SSAP) tool for rating movie reviews.
Note that to run this project the main file for feature-ased grammar (SenGrammar.fcfg) is not publicly avaible (we provided another feature grammar called gramtest.fcfg but this cannot be used to run the main project).
